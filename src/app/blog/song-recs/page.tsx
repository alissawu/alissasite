            <p>
              After a summer at Citadel, my friend decided to drop quant and pursue his lifelong dream of being a DJ. 
              I didn&apos;t understand it at first, but a summer in SF showed me that the people who truly do what they want are happier. 
              He&apos;s been at Stanford for the last 4 years, so I guess the culture inspired him sooner. 
              Anyway, he&apos;s a hardcore West-Coast lover, and I&apos;ve spent my whole life on the East Coast, 
              so the goal here was to introduce NYC-ish sounds to his sound-repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              So this isn&apos;t geared to my tastes, but rather the overlap of what I like and what I hear in NYC,
              along with some unique sounds I thought were pretty good. The categories are not rigorous.
