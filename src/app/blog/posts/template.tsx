              I have a friend who dropped quant to pursue being a DJ. He's a hardcore West-Coast lover, 
              and I've spent my whole life on the East Coast (aside from this summer in SF, which I really liked!), 
              so the goal here was to introduce NYC-ish sounds to his sound-repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              So this isn't geared to my tastes, but rather the overlap of what I like and what I hear in NYC,
              along with some unique sounds I thought were pretty good.
              Obviously the categories aren't great, and there's a lot of overlap, but this is fun for a first blog post. 
              I'll probably revise it later...
