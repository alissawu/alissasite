## Images
It felt very nauseous when the project cards resized. After going on some shopping sites. I realized the issue was that I was resizing both height and width. 
The options were to either maintain card size, or only resize width. I only resized width, and stopped feeling nauseous

## CSS
I wasn't able to see CSS updates I made locally, because of browser CSS caching
Cmd-Opt-R (hard-reload on mac) bypasses the cache for CSS requests on subsequent page loads
